Unfortunately, there exist more time-efficient techniques such as Dynamic Programming that aren't touched upon until later 3000 level courses. That being said, the aim of this class project was to create a beginner-friendly way of comparing the efficiency of Dynamic Programming and recursion simultaneously. The UI presents users with a sample problem like the Fibonacci Sequence and runs both Dynamic Programming and recursive calls to the problem. Not only does the program output the results, but it also shows the respective run-times of each method."

The video series was created by Youtuber Matt Heaney and acts as a coding tutorial on how to develop a game from start to finish in XCode. The game itself is very similar to Space Invaders with its concept of spaceships, lasers, and seemingly endless enemy spaceships. While I had made decent progress into the series, I was soon caught up in other things and the personal project was left on hold. "

While the game may look simple my task in this project was to make sure that the a.i.could NEVER lose to the human player which definitely took a fair share of time. "
